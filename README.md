# Blog source lives here

My [blog](http://martinthenext.github.io/) is hosted on Github pages and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To add new content:

1. Add a new Markdown file to `content/post`
2. `hugo server -D` to preview an updated version at `http://localhost:1313/`
3. `hugo` to recompile the files into `martinthenext.github.io` directory
4. Copy `martinthenext.github.io` contents to a location where the Github pages repo is checked out
