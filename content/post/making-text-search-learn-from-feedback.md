Proud to announce my introductory tutorial on hacking together a toy search engine made it into my beloved ["build your own"](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x/blob/master/README.md#build-your-own-search-engine) list. The tutorial briefly explains basic concepts from Information Retrieval (vector space model, features, tf-idf, etc.) and proposes a simple, nearest neighbor-based approach to use relevance feedback in ranking. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/filament-ai/making-text-search-learn-from-feedback-4fe210fd87b0).
