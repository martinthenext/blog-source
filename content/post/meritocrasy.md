[Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnberg](http://www.rwagner.net/libretti/meisters/e-meisters-a3s5.html) by Wagner:

>Scorn not the Masters, I bid you,

>and honour their art!

>What speaks high in their praise

>fell richly in your favour.

>Not to your ancestors, however worthy,

>not to your coat-of-arms, spear, or sword,

>but to the fact that you are a poet,

>that a Master has admitted you -

>to that you owe today your highest happiness.
