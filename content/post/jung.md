[Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology (1920)](https://archive.org/details/collectedpaperso00junguoft), very interesting and connects with ideas from [ZAMM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) in various ways.

To me, Bradbury's [Dandelion Wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion_Wine) is an ultimate introduction to extraversion and a description of a culture built on extraversion. Jung says in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aoDdAIIRTw) that the U. S. is "extraverted like hell" :) Russia, on the contrary, seems culturally introverted to me.
