Title: My first post (lame title, I know)

All the time I've been using livejournal I've been concerned about two things:

1. Blog posts, which are of a great value to me, are stored on other people's server I have no access to. If something went wrong with that server or servise my data would be unaccessible. That is why I've always considered running a stand-alone blog on my own server.
1. No syntax highlighting for programming languages.

It seems like both issues are now solved by this very servise. I find it extremely awesome. I'm still going to use my livejournal account for russian language / blogging. This blog I'm going to make my tech blog, as it seems it has everything a tech blog needs.

P.S. Code snippet to test stuff:

    def __init__(self):
        pss = "and it also has a great online editor"
        print pss
